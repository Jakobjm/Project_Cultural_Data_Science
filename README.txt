This github repository contains the code for my final project on Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.

It contains the python script I used to select data from the BBR register jsonfiles i got from datafordeler.dk
the files themselves are unfortunately too big to put in this repository, but can as of 2022/01/11 still be found at datafordeler.dk
under BBR totaludtr√¶k using kommunekode 0101 for Copenhagen and 0751 for Aarhus.

Theres an R markdown that details data wrangling and cleaning, and an app.R that contains the shiny app.

By the license in the BBR register data, it is pertinent for me to say that no danish officials have accepted, supported, recommended, or marketed this analysis.
The data is free for commercial use as well as non-commercial use, and as such is not in conflict with danish law.

Regarding the code in this repository, it is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License
And as such everyone is free to use, adapt, and remix the code, given that they use it non-commercially, and give due credit.
